Data analysis showing similarities between separate sides of a polarized America

_______

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an informative and useful story with data, using the General Social Survey (GSS) and potentially other data sources. The goal is to highlight areas where Americans on opposite sides of the political spectrum are similar, in order to demonstrate that people may not be as different as they think. 

### Objectives

1. **Identify Similarities**: Analyze data to find common ground between different political groups on the basis of very low-level moral questions.
2. **Highlight Differences**: In the interest of fairness, also identify and present extreme differences that the data reveal.

### Data Sources

- **General Social Survey (GSS)**: The primary data source for this analysis.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Other relevant datasets may be incorporated to enrich the analysis.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from the GSS and other sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, normalizing data formats, etc.
3. **Data Analysis**: Use statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and trends.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to effectively communicate the findings.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

### Conclusion

By examining both the similarities and differences between Americans on opposite sides of the political spectrum, this project aims to foster a better understanding and potentially reduce polarization by highlighting common ground.
